\prefacesection{Abstract}
We are living in a time more disruptive than any in history and AI is leading the charge.  IBM's Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov at chess in [insert year here].  Watson beat Ken Jennings at Jeopardy in [insert here].  DeepMind's AlphaGo beat the world Go champion in [insert year here].  We have vision systems that are superhuman at classifying images of cats and dogs.  We have NLP systems that can pass a Turing test [GPT3].  We have systems that can synthesize voice, draw avocado armchairs, and more.  The AI hammer is so strong that nails are begging for it.  One of these nails is medicine. The primary role of medicine is, and should be, to help the sick.  Many argue an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  My thesis statement is this: we need to be banging this prevention nail with the all powerful AI hammer.  Specifically I show results in Dermatology and Critical Care.
