Imagine a world where ubiquitous sensors are constantly monitoring your health and predicting whether you are at risk for a life threatening condition.  Many life threatening conditions can be cured if treated early enough.  Further, many life threatening conditions are obvious to a trained medical expert.  Can the recent advances in AI be leveraged to distill some of this highly valuable medical expertise?  If so, it could be distributed widely, run 24/7, and cost little more than the cost of electricity to run it.  In this thesis I argue that future is not so distant.  Specifically I show results in detecting skin cancer from photos that any smartphone can take, and assessing risk for a wide range of heart and other internal organ conditions from waveform signals such as ECG and PPG, both of which a smartwatch can measure.
